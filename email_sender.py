I hope you're doing well! My name is Dhruv Parmar, and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Jio, specializing in backend development.

I have 19 months of experience working on backend systems, where I've led API migrations, improved performance, and ensured maintainability without compromising functionality.

I'm interested in applying for SDE-1 roles at {company_name} and would love to connect to explore potential opportunities.

I have attached my resume to this email. Alternatively, you can also view it here: {RESUME_LINK}

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
